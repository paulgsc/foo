## ðŸš¨ Warning: Proceed with Caution ðŸš¨

**This project is maintained by a complete Rust noob.** The code here is unpolished, experimental, and downright broken. **beware of bad code!**

---

## A Fresh Start

This project started as a fork of [fang](https://github.com/ayrat555/fang) but has since taken a vastly different direction.  
While I am grateful for the inspiration and prior contributions, this project is now a lighthouse for my ideas. I plan  
to explore new concepts, implementations, and paradigms that may diverge significantly from the original goals.

The license remains as is to honor the roots of this project, and I express my heartfelt gratitude to the original authors for their work.

## High-level Overview

Hereâ€™s how the system works in its current iteration (subject to evolution as the project progresses):  

- Clients enqueue tasks into a queue.  
- The server starts multiple workers to handle the queues.  
- Workers process tasks concurrently, ensuring scalability and efficiency.  
- Tasks are executed with configurable retries, timeouts, and unique handling features.

## Why This Fork Exists

This fork reflects my personal journey of learning and creating. It is not meant to be a drop-in replacement for the original project but an experiment in its own right.  

To respect the original work and its maintainers, I will not be merging upstream changes but will keep the license and attribution intact.

## Current Features

- **Guaranteed Execution**: Ensures at least one execution of a task.  
- **Async Workers**: Leverages [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/) for asynchronous task execution.  
- **Configurable Execution**: Context-aware tasks with unique worker queues.  
- **Retries and Timeouts**: Flexible backoff strategies for retries and task timeouts.  
- **Scalability**: Horizontally scalable architecture for distributed task execution.  
- **Safety First**: 100% safe Rust with `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`.  

---

## Future Plans

- Experimentation with new task scheduling mechanisms.  
- Support for alternative storage backends.  
- Exploration of dynamic worker allocation based on task load.
