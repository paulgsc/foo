/// The [`BackgroundTask`] trait is used to define the behaviour of a task. You must implement this
/// trait for all tasks you want to execute.
///
/// The [`BackgroundTask::TASK_NAME`] attribute must be unique for the whole application. This
/// attribute is critical for reconstructing the task back from the database.
///
/// The [`BackgroundTask::AppData`] can be used to argument the task with application specific
/// contextual information. This is useful for example to pass a database connection pool to the
/// task or other application configuration.
///
/// The [`BackgroundTask::run`] method is the main method of the task. It is executed by the
/// the task queue workers.
///

/// # Example
/// ```
/// use async_trait::async_trait;
/// use backie::{BackgroundTask, CurrentTask};

/// #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
/// pub struct MyTask {}
